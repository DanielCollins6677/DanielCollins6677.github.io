        <h2 id="post-1">A New Beginning</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 24.01.2020</h5>
        
       <p>Today I started a new Chapter of my life I decided to finally,
             actually try to learn how to code. I wasn't sure were to start so after a short
              google search I found a website going over how to start programming. It gave
               me the advise to first figure out the basics aka: how does a computer even 
               work. Well, I did that and I did it no where else than Khan Acadamy (KA for short).
                This was my first interaction with the site and I fell in love immediatly. Although
                 I don't appreciate getting treated like a <em>child</em>.</p>

        <h2 id="post-2">My Venture into HTML and CSS</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 25.01.2020</h5>
        <p>After I woke up today I immediatly went over to my laptop 
            and came back to KA now with the basic computer knowledge needed I was ready
             to start my descend into the depths of HTML and CSS. Now I was learning it
              all faster than I thought I would but also I was just enthralled I never 
              knew I could be so excited to learn something new. It was just great and 
              now after I have the tiniest shred of an Idea what I am doing I thought 
              why not make a blog and create an artificial entry from yesterday?</p>

        <h2 id="post-3">The second step</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 26.01.2020</h5>
        <p>Today I started a little later on KA than yesterday and also spend a little 
            bit less time on the site. However, I started searching out different 
            sources via Google if I had a question or a cool idea so if anything 
            I actually spend more time on coding today. I learned about CSS specificity 
            and writing code that interacts with different parts of a website, in a 
            way that isn´t bound to the class system. I also figured out how to 
            incorporate audio and video files into a website aswell as how to 
            incorporate a youtube video so that was fun. I also tidied up the website 
            a bit so now it doesn´t look like total crap and I added a link to one 
            of my favorite rimworld modder´s patreon Tomorrow school starts 
            again and that I am definetly NOT excited for.  </p>

        <h2 id="post-4">A new challenger approches!</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 27.01.2020</h5>
        <p>Another day another challenge today I dove into JavaScript with KA's 
            animation cours and while I wasn't able to spend as much time on it 
            today, thanks to school and going out eating with my family (btw turkish 
            cuisine can be really fucking good), I still feel like I made some progress 
            today. I learned how to use the draw function, how to use variables 
            aswell as making those interact with eachother through some maths. 
            So all in all while a bit shorter today still quite happy. </p>

    <div class="info">
        <h2 id="post-5">Took a break</h2>
        <h5>Posted on 29.01.2020</h5>
        <p>Yesterday I did in fact as the title suggest take a break but today 
            I was back at learning more about JavaScript. I learned how to right 
            text in JavaScript aswell as how to use that text in variables and made 
            my most ambitious animation yet and while it is still just a 
            trainmoving from left to right I am still quite proud of myself. I 
            have however not yet figured out how to show the animation on a 
            website but I am sure I will find out eventually
            and until then I have it stored on my harddrive.</p>

        <h2 id="post-6"> Designer Babies </h2>
        <h5>Posted on 11.08.2020</h5>
        <p>The idea that future genetic technology may lead to generations of children
            designed to be rid of genetic diseases, disabilities and with a good genetic
            basis for beauty, intelligence and strength. A designer baby is a baby 
            whose genetic makeup has been selected or altered, often to include a particular
            gene or to remove genes associated with a disease. This process usually 
            involves analysing a wide range of human embryos to identify genes associated 
            with particular diseases and characteristics, and selecting embryos that have the
            desired genetic makeup; a process known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis. 
            Other potential methods by which a baby's genetic information can be altered 
            involve directly editing the genome before birth. This process is not routinely 
            performed and only one instance of this is known to have occurred as of 2019,
            where Chinese twins Lulu and Nana were edited as embryos, causing widespread criticism.</p>
